  "mcp.subtitle": "The foundation of intelligent agent collaboration",
  "mcp.what": "What is MCP?",
  "mcp.p1": "Multi-Context Protocol (MCP) is an advanced communication framework that enables AI agents to share contextual information, maintain state awareness, and coordinate actions across distributed systems. MCP allows agents to understand not just what to do, but why they're doing it, by preserving the context of tasks and decisions.",
  "mcp.p2": "Unlike traditional API-based communication, MCP implements semantic understanding of context, allowing agents to adapt their behavior based on situational awareness, historical patterns, and collaborative goals.",

  "a2a.subtitle": "Q orchestrates intelligent collaboration between specialized agents",
  "a2a.ecosystem": "The Q Agent Ecosystem",
  "a2a.p1": "Q serves as the head agent in our Agent-to-Agent workflow architecture, coordinating specialized agents to accomplish complex tasks through seamless collaboration. Each agent in the ecosystem specializes in specific domains while communicating through the Multi-Context Protocol.",
  "a2a.p2": "When a task is received, Q analyzes the requirements, decomposes it into subtasks, and orchestrates the appropriate agents to handle each component. The agents work in parallel or sequentially, sharing context and results through MCP to ensure cohesive outcomes.",
